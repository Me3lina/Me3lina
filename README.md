- 👋 Welcome, I’m Melina
- 👀 I’m interested in GIS and coding in JS is a must for GEE
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things but mainly the Remote Sensing tools
- 🌷 I’m looking to collaborate on urbanism and environmental projects as a designer
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love alfajores with dulce de leche and I can walk kilometers to get one.

  😊 Creative & curious human being 😄
